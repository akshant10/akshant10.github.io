### BACKGROUND

Data mining is a very elementary step in the data science life cycle. In this Research paper, I have used Selenium to extract data from Google maps which is an open-source web-based automation tool. Hence the scrapped data is converted into structured data using Python which is further visualized in Tableau. I have considered the case of Mumbai Western express highway for this research purpose. The result of this project helps to find the most congested areas across the highway in both directions, time chart, the average time to travel in various hours such as morning, evening, night, etc.
