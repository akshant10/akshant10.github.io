As a Data enthusiast, I'm always on the lookout for new and interesting datasets to explore. That's why I recently turned to social media to see what insights I could gain from my own Instagram Account. Using Python and powerful libraries like NetworkX and Selenium for web automation, I was able to build network graphs that visualized the connections between my followers and following users. And by using Pandas to create and manipulate data frames, I was able to collect data for more than 50 users.

The results of my analysis were fascinating. By studying the connections between my followers and following, I was able to identify groups of users who were particularly connected within my social network. Each user is represented as a node or a vertex, and the connections between users are represented by edges or links. 

In the future, I'm excited to collect even more data and explore more advanced techniques like clustering and predictive modeling. Network graphs have a wide range of applications in various domains, including social media analysis, transportation and logistics, finance, healthcare, biology and genetics, energy and utilities, and urban planning. By representing complex systems and relationships in a visual and intuitive way, network graphs can help to identify patterns, optimize operations, and make informed decisions in these fields. I can't wait to see what other discoveries await!
